# About haxeunity (Haxe, Unity and C#)

![Haxe logo](../img/haxe_unity_logos.png)

I was working on a Unity 3D project, and I was curious if I could get it to work with Haxe-C# target.
To be clear, I know this could be called C# documentation as well, but I needed more info about the combination Haxe/Unity/C#.
That is what I will be focusing on.
