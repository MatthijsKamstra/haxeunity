# Writing example

Simple write to a file. Can't make it more glamorous.
In this example we will use Haxe specific code that can be used for other `sys` targets (lua, python, neko, cpp, hl, php, java, cs) as well.

The short version of the folder structure will not work without the files Unity needs.
If you want to know more about that, read the [setup](../00setup/example.md)

```
+ unity-haxe-helloworld
	+ Source
		- Main.hx
	- build.hxml
```

## The Main.hx

Check out the whole [`Main.hx`](/code/Source/Main.hx) for more details.

That is a lot of code so I will focus on the specific part that writes the file.



```haxe
	function Awake() {
		trace('Writing example');

		var dataFileName:String = "hello.txt";
		var filePath = Path.join([Application.streamingAssetsPath, dataFileName]);

		// check if this folder exists, if not create!
		if(!FileSystem.exists(Application.streamingAssetsPath)){
			FileSystem.createDirectory(Application.streamingAssetsPath);
			trace('"StreamAssets"-folder created!');
		}

		var str:String = 'Hello World!\nWritten on: ' + Date.now().toString();
		File.saveContent(filePath, str);

		trace('${filePath} is generated');
	}

```

In the code we see some Haxe specific code and some Unity specific code:

```haxe
var dataFileName:String = "hello.txt";
var filePath = Path.join([Application.streamingAssetsPath, dataFileName]);
```

- `Path.join` is Haxe System code (works on all Haxe system target like c++, python, etc )
- `Application.streamingAssetsPath` is specific Unity code, its a folder in `Assets/StreamingAssets`

```haxe
// check if this folder exists, if not create!
if(!FileSystem.exists(Application.streamingAssetsPath)){
	FileSystem.createDirectory(Application.streamingAssetsPath);
	trace('"StreamAssets"-folder created!');
}
```

Default the streaming Assets folder is not generated by Unity. So first we check if it exists and if that is not the case, we generate that folder.

```haxe
var str:String = 'Hello World!\nWritten on: ' + Date.now().toString();
File.saveContent(filePath, str);
```

Now we know the folder exists, we can save any data in there.

## The Haxe build file, build.hxml

You will need a build file (read more about that in the [build example](../09build/example.md)).
I work on osx, so you might need to tweak this script for your os


```bash
-cp Source
-D net-ver=40
# -net-lib C:\Program Files (x86)\Unity\Editor\Data\Managed\UnityEngine.dll
# -net-lib /Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/Managed/UnityEngine.dll
-net-lib /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2018.3.12f1/Unity.app/Contents/Managed/UnityEngine.dll
-cs Assets/Code
-D no-compilation
-D real-position
Main
```



## Build the code

To finish and see what we have, build the file and see the result

1. Open your terminal
2. `cd ` to the correct folder where you have saved the `build.hxml`
3. type `haxe build.hxml`
4. press enter
