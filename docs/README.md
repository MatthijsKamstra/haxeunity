# Haxe and Unity (C#)

With most of the documentation I wrote, it was something that I needed. Because this type of documentation is valuable only when you have no idea how to start. It's the basic stuff that I run into when I start with a new Haxe target.

I would suggest you would visit [Haxe and System Targets](https://matthijskamstra.github.io/haxesys/) as well because it covers the system targets and C# is that as well.

This documentation is focussed on Unity and Haxe and specifics to get it working in with Unity.
