## haxe.org Python

I wish there was more info, but there is none!

So I collected some links with more info about Haxe and Python:

- [PyCon HK 2015](https://haxe.io/@andy_li/PyCon%20HK%202015.pdf) - Haxe-Python presentation of Andy Li at the Python conference 2015 in Hong Kong.
- [haxe python tutorial by Urs Stutz](https://steemit.com/programming/@kkaos/haxe-python-tutorial-intro) this list is taken from this pages.
- [github.com/ustutz/Dataquest](https://github.com/ustutz/Dataquest) - Solution to the DataQuest missions in Haxe by Urs Stutz
- [PyHelpers.hx](https://github.com/andyli/haxe-usage-survey/blob/master/src/PyHelpers.hx) - Haxe Macro, to make function calls with named arguments easier by Andy Li
- [Haxe-usage-survey](https://github.com/andyli/haxe-usage-survey) - Response data and code for the analysis of a survey by Andy Li
- [Extern generator for the Haxe Python target](https://github.com/andyli/pyextern) by Andy Li.


## Python?

Python itself is beyond the scope of this resource. Its assumed that you already are familiar with it, and you are here to learn about the Haxe Python target.

The following resources are worth checking out as a refresher:

* <http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/>
* <http://www.learnpython.org/>
* <https://www.dataquest.io/> - excellent online course in data science for Python</li>

All you learn from these resources about Python is applicable here!
