# Haxe and Unity (C#)

![Haxe logo](img/haxe_unity_logos.png)

I was working on a Unity 3D project, and I was curious if I could get it to work with Haxe-C# target.
To be clear, I know this could be called C# documentation as well, but I needed more info about the combination Haxe/Unity/C#.
That is what I will be focusing on.

Practical information how to start are none existing, so I started to document my research.
I hope this will help. If you think so, why not help with [contribution](contribute.md) to this tutorial site.


### How will this help me?

It will get you started with C# (Unity) **and** Haxe.
How to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

### Who is this for?

For clever, cool and handsome developers. Duh! :D

## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.
That's why I use Markdown. Developers use it, but is just writing in plain English so **everybody** can write documentation!
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.
Even if you are not a developer. Don't want to clone everything, you still can change the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).
And as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation and open-sourcing it this way, but other beat me.
Although I was already writing everything with markdown, it looked like a good idea to use Gitbook to "publish" it. Writing documentation is like writing a book.
