# About

There is always a need to store data, one way or another. In the example we store our data in a `.json` file.

There is a better way to do something similar in Haxe.

In this example we will use [haxelow](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxelow)

```
haxelib install haxelow
```


## When to use HaxeLow

Straight from the lowdb docs:

HaxeLow/lowdb is a convenient method for storing data without setting up a database server. It's fast enough and safe to be used as an embedded database.

However, if you need high performance and scalability more than simplicity, you should stick to databases like MongoDB.
