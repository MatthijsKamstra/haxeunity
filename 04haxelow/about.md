# About

There is always a need to store data, one way or another. In the example we store our data in a `.json` file.

In the previous example we used [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) for this.


But there is a better way to do something similar in Haxe.

In this example we will use [haxelow](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxelow)

```
haxelib install haxelow
```
